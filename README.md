# NumericalAnalysis
A Project with an Interactive GUI in Python that implements some of common Numerical Analysis Techniques. 

This Project consists of two Parts:

## Part-1:

A Root Finder Program which takes as an input the equation, the
technique to use and its required parameters (e.g. interval for the bisection method).
Also, There's a general algorithm that takes as an input the equation to solve and
outputs its roots.

The aim of this part is to compare and analyze the behavior of the different numerical methods
: Bisection, False-position, Fixed point, Newton-Raphson and Secant.


## Part-2:

A program for querying the values of specific points using
interpolation which takes as an input the polynomial order, sample point(s), corresponding value(s),
the interpolation technique to use (Newton â€“ Lagrange) and the query point(s).
